/**
 * Event dispatcher configuration file.
 *
 * Carrot uses a simple event system, where each event is
 * identified by a string ID. It is used to hook your code into
 * Carrot's core without actually editing the files.
 * 
 * In this file, you can configure the event dispatcher by
 * accessing $dispatcher variable. The dispatcher object
 * instantiated is the implementation you defined at
 * configuration.
