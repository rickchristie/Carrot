<h1>Welcome to Carrot!</h1>

<p>
    Carrot is yet another PHP framework. It was created as a
    learning project from an amateur programmer, hence it is
    experimental in nature. Probably the most defining
    characteristics of Carrot is the abolition of globals and
    statics, along with the requirement to use its built-in
    dependency injection container to wire dependencies into your
    classes. Carrot is still unstable, with many changes and
    features planned.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        PHP 5.3+ (Carrot uses namespaces and anonymous functions).
    </li>
    <li>
        Apache2 web server (Carrot is not tested in other web
        servers).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Framework objectives</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Create a framework without using the keyword global or
        static. Fully recognize the dangerous nature of global
        state and avoid it at all costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Relying on dependency injection container to manage the
        dependencies of user classes, thus eliminating the need
        for a global objects and registry.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build and make use of decoupled classes, avoid inheritance
        whenever possible. This would allow the user's classes
        to be written as a plain old PHP object managed by the
        dependency injection container.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the core as small and focused as possible. Carrot's
        main goal is to be the front controller, routing the
        request, wiring the dependencies of the user's classes,
        and setting up a comfortable development environment for
        the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continue the development by adding libraries, which are
        essentially just decoupled classes with proper namespace.
        Each library must not know that it is being used inside
        a framework, people should be able to just copy and paste
        the library files to use it.
    </li>
</ul>
