<h1>Code styling and structure conventions</h1>

<p>
    Below is the list of code writing rules that I adopt when
    developing Carrot. Most of them are based on personal choice
    rather than a logical decision. However, it is important to
    have consistency, so Carrot's code will have to follow all of
    them. It should also be mentioned that most of them are
    adapted from
    <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/contributing/code/standards.html">Symfony's Coding Standards</a>.
</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Class names are <code>PascalCased</code>. However,
        acronyms and abbreviations should remain uppercase.
        Example: <code>FooBar</code>, <code>HTTPRoute</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Method names and variable names are
        <code>camelCased</code>. Like class names, acronyms and
        abreviations remain in their uppercase form. Example:
        <code>haveSomeSleep()</code>, <code>getURI()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interface names should be suffixed with
        <code>Interface</code>. Example:
        <code>RouteInterface</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Indent to four spaces, and do not use tabs. You should be
        able to configure your editor to convert the tab keys to
        four spaces.
    </li>
    <li>
            Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style">Allman/BSD</a>
            style in indenting your curly brackets. This means
            <code>{}</code> always have their own line. For example:
    
<pre>class IndentingExample
{
    public function someMethod()
    {
        echo 'Hello World!';
    }
}
</pre>
    
    </li>
    <li>
        Put space after control statements that is followed by
        round brackets like <code>if</code>,
        <code>switch</code>, <code>while</code>,
        <code>foreach</code> and <code>for</code>. Example:
        <code>if ($var)</code> instead of <code>if($var)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Always use curly brackets <code>{}</code> after control
        statements even if the block consists of only one
        statement. This makes it easier to spot and read them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not put spaces after opening round bracket or before
        closing it. Example: <code>if ($var)</code> instead of
        <code>if ( $var )</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If round bracket contents are too many to write in a
        single line, you may put opening round bracket on the
        first line and the contents indented forward, the closing
        round bracket have its own line. Example:

<pre>
$groceries = new GroceryList(
    'apple',
    'banana',
    'bread',
    'butter',
    'water'
);
</pre>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Operators</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Add spaces before and after
        <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.php">all operators</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> keyword instead
        of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use ternary operators sparingly, favoring the
        <code>if</code> block even for simple cases.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Always have a doc block on top of all methods, class,
        and properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        Protected methods must have <code>@see</code> tags in its
        doc block that acts as a list of methods that call the
        protected methods directly.
    </li>
    <li>
        When mentioning a class from another namespace inside a
        comment, doc block or otherwise, write it as if you are
        writing the class name as a code in the class instead of
        a comment. This means you have to take the
        <code>use</code> keyword into account.
    </li>
    <li>
        Always use <code>//</code> to start inline comments, not
        <code>#</code> or <code>/* */</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Constants and booleans</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use uppercase to denote booleans, e.g. <code>TRUE</code>,
        <code>FALSE</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use uppercase to denote PHP native constants and null
        value, e.g. <code>ENT_QUOTES</code>, <code>NULL</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use single quotes <code>'string'</code> whenever
        possible. However, do not hesitate to use double quotes
        <code>"string {$var}"</code> if you think it will make
        your code more readable.
    </li>
    <li>
        When using double quotes to mix strings with variables,
        always wrap the variable with curly brackets. Example:
        <code>"This is a {$variable}"</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Class structure</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        PHP files should not end with PHP closing tag
        <code>?&gt;</code>. This is so that characters
        do not get sent accidentally to the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        The usage of <code>var</code> is not allowed. Declare the
        property's visibility explicitly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Declare class properties before you declare methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        Public methods are declared before protected methods.
        Private methods are declared after protected methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the class uses a class from another namespace that is
        not its subnamespace, always use the <code>use</code>
        keyword.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>use</code> keyword should be declared only
        once, with used classes separated by commas.
    </li>
</ul>
