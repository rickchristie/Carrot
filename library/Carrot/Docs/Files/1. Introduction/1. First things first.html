<h1>Carrot is an experimental framework</h1>

<p>
    The first thing you need to know about Carrot is, it's an
    experimental framework built by an amateur PHP programmer.
    It's not a super framework built by a super-coder (not that
    you should view any frameworks that way either), and it's not
    ready for production yet. So expect to see some
    <code>WTF</code> moments, and bugs. Don't expect awesomeness.
