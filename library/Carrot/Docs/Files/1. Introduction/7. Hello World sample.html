<h1>Hello World in Carrot</h1>

<p class="note">
    Please note that in Carrot, you can replace configuration
    classes with your own implementations, so this tutorial
    can only be guaranteed to work with default, out-of-the-box
    configurations.
</p>

<p>
    Here are the list of steps you must do to create a simple
    hello world webpage in Carrot:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create the <code>HelloWorld</code> class.</li>
    <li>Configure dependency injections of <code>HelloWorld</code>.</li>
    <li>Create and add a route that points to <code>HelloWorld</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Of course in a real world application, you'll still have to
    think about layering and unit testing, but as an introduction
    to Carrot, this will do.
