<h1>Carrot requires you to use its dependency injection container</h1>

<p>
    You can't use Carrot without utilizing its dependency
    injection container. Carrot uses the container to instantiate
    your class and wire its dependencies, so without it, there's
    no framework. Using dependency injection container right at
    the core is what allows you to use plain old PHP objects for
    all your classes. There are of course drawbacks for this
    decision, but I think the benefits far outweigh them.
</p>

<h2>Your classses and the container</h2>

<p>
    Carrot does not give your classes access to the container
    (well, not that I know of anyway), so the classes you wrote
    will not be aware that it is being managed and instantiated
    by a depedency injection container. This is the preferred way
    of doing things, since having access to the container masks
    the API of your classes - it will no different than having
    globals and statics in your code.
</p>

<p>
    By not being aware of the dependency injection container,
    all of your classes, as a result, will be completely
    oblivious to the fact that they are called by a framework.
    This also means that you don't have go through Carrot if
    you want to unit test your classes.
