-----

- Dependency Injection Container
    - Created ObjectReference to refer to instance names.
    - Instance names now in this form: Carrot\Core\FrontController{Main:Transient}
    - Providers can be bound only to specific instance names.
    - Simplified ProviderInterface.
- Router
    - Simplified RouteInterface.
    - Simplified Router.
    - Route classes now instantiated by the DIC, means they can have their own dependencies.
    - Removed RouterInterface, usage of Carrot's Router class is now mandatory.
- Response
    - Headers are now only sent when Response::send() is called.
    - Response now a value object.
- FrontController
    - Internal redirection is back, but without redirection history and maximum redirection count.


VERSION 0.2
-----------

- Refactored spaghetti index.php to \Carrot\Core\FrontController.
- User's controller are no longer called controller, it is called routine class/object. The method to be called is called 'routine method'. This removes ambiguity in Carrot's documentation. Carrot doesn't care if the routine class is controller, view, model, etc., so the term 'controller' is misleading.
- Removed config.php, all configurations now done in provider files
- Dependency Injection Container
    - Decouples the DIC from the responsibility of loading the class files.
    - Removed mandatory usage of PSR-0 'Vendor\Namespace' namespace pattern.
    - Removed the concept of 'default dependency registration files', _dicregistrations.php now gone.
    - Configurations are now stored inside separate provider classes.
    - Explicit assignment of providers to a particular class.
    - You can no longer inject the (currently used) DIC instance to any class.
- Router
    - Each route now is a separate class, implementing RouteInterface.
    - Supports two way routing, no longer uses chain of responsibility pattern.
- Session
    - Renamed to Carrot\Session\NativeSession.
- Database
    - Added Carrot\Database\MySQLiStatementWrapper.
- SimpleDocs
    - Used for sample application and showing the docs.
- ExceptionHandling
    - Every errors now turned into ErrorException.
