    - Providers can be bound only to specific instance names.
    - Simplified ProviderInterface.

    - Simplified RouteInterface.
    - Simplified Router.
    - Route classes now instantiated by the DIC, means they can have their own dependencies.

VERSION 0.2
-----------

- Refactored spaghetti index.php to \Carrot\Core\FrontController.
- User's controller are no longer called controller, it is called routine class/object. The method to be called is called 'routine method'. This removes ambiguity in Carrot's documentation. Carrot doesn't care if the routine class is controller, view, model, etc., so the term 'controller' is misleading.

- Dependency Injection Container
    - Decouples the DIC from the responsibility of loading the class files.
    - Removed mandatory usage of PSR-0 'Vendor\Namespace' namespace pattern.

    - Configurations are now stored inside separate provider classes.
    - Explicit assignment of providers to a particular class.
    - You can no longer inject the (currently used) DIC instance to any class.
- Router
    - Each route now is a separate class, implementing RouteInterface.
    - Supports two way routing, no longer uses chain of responsibility pattern.

    - Renamed to Carrot\Session\NativeSession.

    - Used for sample application and showing the docs.
