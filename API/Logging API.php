//---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Logging in Carrot.
 * 
 * A collection of library classes that is used by the framework
 * and the user to do log messages.
 * 
 * Version 0.3 of Carrot will not have logging capabilities.
 * This is because there are other better logging libraries out
 * there, and logging is really in the application's domain.
 * 
//---------------------------------------------------------------
 * PHP already has excellent logging mechanism, which can be
 * used by the user in the exception handler (you just have
 * to make sure the exception handler can be instantiated using
 * the DIC).
 * 
 * Also, there's no time
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Where to save log messages?
 * 
 * Take hints (or maybe use) Seldaek's monolog.
 * See Python's Logbook
