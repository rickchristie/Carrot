//---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Autoloading in Carrot.
 * 
 * A collection of library classes that is used by the framework
 * to autoload the user's classes.
 * 
 * Carrot has an autoloader which follows PSR-0 autoloading
 * convention, this is instantiated before loading the autoloader
 * file, but the usage is optional. The user can elect to use
 * their own autoloader class, or maybe use functions instead.
 * Using an implementation of Carrot's autoloader, however, will
 * allow autoloading information to be displayed in debugging.
