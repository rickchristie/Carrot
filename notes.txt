Some conventions:

File name that holds a class should have an uppercase first character, the rest of the character must be lowercase.
For example, this is correct:
	
	Home.php
	Home_page.php

This is wrong:

	home.php
	homePage.php

File name must be the same with the class name that the file contains.

	Home.php contains 'Home' class
	Home_page.php contains 'Home_page' class

Oh, and yeah, the folder name must be all lowercase
