<h1>Quick Introduction to Carrot</h1>
<p>The very first thing you need to know is that Carrot is an experimental framework built by someone who is in junior level programming, so don't expect too much. Another thing is that I am developing Carrot for my personal use (and as a learning project), so some of the design decisions might not suit you. Since Carrot is still in its early stages, you might not want to use it in production.</p>
<h2>Globals and statics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The keyword static now enables us to use methods and properties (state) per-class and not on a per-object basis. This basically leaves us with class oriented programming. This seems to make a lot of things simpler, at a first glance, but will almost certainly hurt you in the long term.&rdquo; - <cite><a href="http://kore-nordmann.de/blog/0103_static_considered_harmful.html">Static Considered Harmful, by Kore Nordmann</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carrot doesn't use globals and statics. This is a design decision already made and it is not going to change. In fact, the entire code in Carrot is written so that when I use it, I never have to resort to global variables or static methods. You can think of Carrot as an ongoing experiment on whether we can write a fully functional PHP framework without the usage of globals and statics.</p>
<p>Ruling out globals and statics means also ruling out <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/registry.html">Registry</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton pattern</a>. This perplexes me for a while, since Carrot as a framework must provide a way for user's classes to access other instantiated objects. I need a way to wire the dependencies without resorting to globals or inheritance. I found the solution in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection container</a> - hence why the usage of dependency injection container is mandatory in Carrot.</p>
<h2>Routine class</h2>
<blockquote><p>rou&bull;tine, noun. a sequence of actions regularly followed; a fixed program. - <cite>New Oxford American Dictionary</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>When you write a web application, you want a routine to be run when it is requested. This routine can be located in a function, an object method, or an anonymous function. For example, <a href="http://silex-project.org/">Silex</a> uses anonymous functions to store these routines, <a href="http://www.limonade-php.net/">Limonade</a> uses regular functions, and <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> uses a controller class (object method). Carrot is an object oriented framework, so your routine must be written inside an object method. We will call the methods that contain these routines: <em>routine methods</em>. The classes/objects that contains these routine methods are henceforth called <em>routine classes/objects</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike other frameworks, your routine class does not need to be your controller. It can be your view, or any random types of class. Carrot is not an MVC framework and doesn't pretend to be one. You can implement MVC in top of Carrot, of course, but whether or not you do that and how exactly you implement it is up to you.</p>
<h2>Dependency Injection Container</h2>
<p>You can freely organize routine methods into routine classes, and you can have as many routine classes as you'd like. But your classes has de</p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>So you have your routine class and you have wired its dependencies using provider classes. How do you determine which routine method is run when a request arrives? This is the responsibility of the <code>Router</code>.</p>
