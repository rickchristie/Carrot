<h1>Quick Introduction to Carrot</h1>

<p>Carrot is yet another PHP framework. It is experimental in nature. Carrot's core libraries depends heavily on anonymous functions and mandates the usage of dependency injection container. Carrot as a framework consists of a front controller, a default router, a dependency injection container, and an error/exception handler. You can say that it's a sort of micro framework.</p>
