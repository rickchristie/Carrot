<h1>Welcome to Carrot</h1>
<p>Carrot is yet another PHP framework. It was created as a learning project, hence it is experimental in nature. Carrot mandates the usage of provider classes to manage dependency injection through its dependency injection container (DIC). Carrot's core classes includes the front controller, exception handler, DIC, and a default router. Carrot is still unstable, with many changes (and features) planned.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>PHP 5.3+ (Carrot uses namespaces and anonymous functions).</li>
    <li>Apache2 web server (Carrot is not tested in other web servers).</li>
</ul>
<h2>You might like Carrot if you..</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You avoid globals and statics at all costs.</li>
    <li>You want a framework that adheres to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal?pli=1">PSR-0 universal autoloader proposal</a>.</li>
    <li>You want a namespaced, loosely coupled framework.</li>
    <li>You despise configuration files.</li>
    <li>You want a framework that uses dependency injection container at its core.</li>
    <li>You just wanted a front controller and a router.</li>
    <li>You like strict coding behavior.</li>
    <li>You think simplicity is awesome.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Framework design goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a framework without using the keyword global or static. Fully recognize the dangerous nature of global state and avoid it at all costs.</li>
    <li>Relying on dependency injection container to manage the dependencies of user classes, thus eliminating the need for a global objects and registry.</li>
    <li>Build and make use of decoupled classes, avoid inheritance whenever possible. This would allow the user's routine class to be a plain old PHP object managed by the dependency injection container.</li>
    <li>Make the core as small and focused as possible. Carrot's main job is to be the front controller, setting up the dependency injection container, instantiating the user's routine object and getting a response from it. It does not know, much less dictate how the routine method is getting the response.</li>
    <li>Allow the user to replace some of the core classes of Carrot using their own class only by implementing an interface as a contract to the core classes.</li>
    <li>Continue the development by adding libraries, which are essentially just decoupled classes that are properly namespaced. Each library must not know that it is being used inside a framework.</li>
</ul>
