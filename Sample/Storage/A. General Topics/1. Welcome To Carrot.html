<h1>Welcome to Carrot</h1>
<p>Carrot is an experimental framework that is created as a learning project. It quickly grows from a CodeIgniter-like framework into another beast of its own. It mandates the usage of dependency injection container and provider classes. Carrot is still very unstable, with many changes to the core planned.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Willingness to work with dependency injection container and provider classes.</li>
    <li>PHP 5.3+ (Carrot uses namespaces and anonymous functions).</li>
    <li>Apache2 web server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>You might like Carrot if you..</h2>
