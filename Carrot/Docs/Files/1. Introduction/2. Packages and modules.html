<h1>Carrot has no notion of packages or modules</h1>

<p>
    Some frameworks divide classes into modules, packages, or
    bundles. Users of said framework are to adhere to the
    structure of its class-packaging method. By doing this, they
    ensure uniformity across the framework and the user's code.
    It allows them to make lots of assumptions on the user's
    code, which they use to provide things that make developer's
    life easier. While this certainly has many advantage, Carrot
    uses a different approach.

<h2>Everything is plain old PHP objects</h2>

<p>
    There are no package structure for you to learn because
    Carrot doesn't have the notion of packages or modules.
    Everything is just plain old PHP objects with namespace,
    wired by Carrot's dependency injection container. Unless
    you're using third party library that requires you to do so,
    there is no need to extend any class, and your classes will
    still be first class citizens, since that's how Carrot's
    designed to work.
</p>

<p>
    If you ask why, I suppose I assume that it would give more
    freedom for the user. Since your classes don't have any
    notable dependencies to the framework, theoretically, you
    should be able to code more freely, as if you were coding
    PHP from scratch. However, as I have said, this framework
    is an experiment, so we will see if it works or not.
