<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    In this section I list some of the design decisions made in
    Carrot, why they were taken, and the effect it has on your
    code should you choose to use Carrot. I also included a
    simple <code>HelloWorld</code> example.

    I will try to be as brief as possible with each page on this
    section. Reading them should give you a decent overview of
    Carrot without delving into much detail.
