<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    The first thing that you must know is that Carrot is an
    experimental framework built as a learning project by an
    amateur programmer. It's not some super framework built
    by super coders (not that you should treat frameworks that
    way either). I guess what I'm trying to say is, expect some
    <code>WTF</code> moments, and bugs. Don't expect awesomeness.

<p> 
    In this section I list the design decisions made in Carrot
    and why they are made. I will try to be as brief as possible
    with each of them. They should give you an overall view about
    the nature of Carrot.
