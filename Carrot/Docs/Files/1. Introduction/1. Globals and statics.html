<h1>Carrot does not use globals and statics</h1>

<p>
    It's not going to change. Almost all code in Carrot is
    written so that the user don't have to resort to globals and
    statics to solve their problems. You can think of Carrot as
    an academic experiment on whether or not we can build a
    fully functional framework in PHP without using globals and
    statics.

<h2>Globals and statics are evil</h2>

<p>
    If you're already familiar with the reasons why globals and
    statics are harmful, you can skip to the next page. If you
    don't have any idea why globals and statics should be
    avoided, I've compiled various resources on the subject.
    Please read on to their respective sources and decide for
    yourself.
</p>

<h3>They make your code hard to understand</h3>

<p>
    Your code will be easier to understand if it were to use
    variables with limited scope. Global variables can be read or
    modified by any part of the program, making it difficult to
    remember or reason about every possible use.

</p>

<h3>They mask dependencies</h3>

<p>
    If you use globals or statics, you can never tell real
    dependencies of a class just by reading it's public API. You
    have to read the source code line-by-line to figure it out.
    You thought <code>Foo</code> class doesn't need
    <code>Bar</code> when in fact, it accesses <code>Bar</code>
    using globals or static reference.

</p>

<h3>They encourage tight coupling</h3>

<p>
    In an ideal world, an object should only be able to interact
    only with other objects which are directly passed into it,
    either through a constructor or method call. With the
    existence of globals and statics, object <code>Foo</code> can
    get a hold of globally accessible <code>Bar</code> even
    though it is not supposed to have access to it. This couples
    <code>Foo</code> with the global state, and if there is a bug
    related to <code>Bar</code>, you'll have to hunt the entire
    source code because you don't know which part of the code
    actually uses it.

<h3>They create &lsquo;spooky action at a distance&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
    Whenever you use globals or statics, you are creating secret
    communications channel that are not exposed in the API.
    This allows
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28computer_science%29">spooky action at a distance</a>
    to happen. It's when you run a method that is supposed to be
    isolated, but an action occurs in distant locations of the
    system which you did not tell the object about. When this
    happens, it forces developers to read every line of code to
    understand potential interactions.

</p>

<h3>They create static dependencies</h3>

<p>
    When you're using static methods, you are creating a static
    dependency that you might not be able to replace by any
    means other than editing the source. Let's say <code>Foo</code>
    has a static dependency to <code>Bar::baz()</code>, and you
    need to switch <code>Baz</code> implementation to
    <code>Bar</code>. You won't be able to do that without
    editing <code>Foo</code>'s source. In OOP with dependency
    injection, you should be able to do this simply by injecting
    another class, adhering to
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov's subtitution principle</a>.

<h3>They make testing very difficult</h3>

<p>
    Unit testing needs seams. It's where the execution of normal
    code is prevented and the class being tested is isolated.
    Without isolation, there is no unit test. Usually to do this,
    polymorphism and dependency injection is utilized. An
    interface is overridden/implemented and injected to the
    class. This is not possible to do with statics. The usage of
    global state also means that every test must start in an
    expected state, or the test will fail.

<h2>Final notes</h2>

<p>
    Please note that there are actually lots of positions in this
    issue. There are people who try to stay away from globals but
    is okay with statics since they don't pollute the namespace.
    There are people who are okay with both of them despite heavy
    arguments against them. Also, there are people who try to
    stay away from it at all costs. I guess Carrot belongs to the
    latter camp.
</p>

<p>
    For me, writing without globals and statics makes things much
    cleaner and forces me to really think about design early on,
    with the side effect of the code being easier to test. If
    this does not appeal to you, then Carrot probably is not
    going to interest you.
