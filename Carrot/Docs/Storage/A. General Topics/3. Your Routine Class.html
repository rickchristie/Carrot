<h1>Your Routine Class</h1>

    When you write a web application, you want a subroutine to be
    run when a particular request is sent to your server. This
    routine code can be written inside a function, a method, or
    an anonymous function. For example, in
    <a href="http://silex-project.org/">Silex</a> we write the
    routines inside anonymous functions, in
    <a href="http://www.limonade-php.net/">Limonade</a> we write
    them in regular functions, and in
    <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> we write
    them in a controller class method.

<p>
    Carrot is an object oriented framework, so your routine
    codes must be written inside a method. In Carrot, the methods
    that contain these routines is called <em>routine methods
    </em>. The classes/objects that contains these routine
    methods are called <em>routine classes/objects</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The name <em>routine class</em> is chosen to be pattern
    independent. Unlike other frameworks, this class doesn't have
    to be your controller. Carrot is not an MVC framework and
    doesn't pretend to be one. You can implement MVC on top of
    Carrot, but it's not the only way you can use it. The only
    responsibility that you have to the framework is that your
    routine method returns an instance of
    <code>Carrot\Core\Response</code> (a value object) when called
    by the front controller. How exactly you plan on doing that is
    up to you.
</p>

<p>
    You write your routine class as plain old PHP object, courtesy
    of the dependency injection container. Here's an example of
    a routine class:
</p>

<pre>namespace Sample;

use Carrot\Core\Response;

class Welcome
{
    public function helloWorld()
    {
        return new Response("&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;h1&gt;");
    }
}
</pre>
