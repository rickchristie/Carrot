<h1>The Request-Response Cycle</h1>

<p>
    I believe it is crucial to understand the request-to-response
    cycle of a framework before using one. Reading this page
    should tell you almost everything you need to know about
    Carrot's core classes and how they are used.

<h2>System bootstrap</h2>

<p>Carr</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements are checked. Execution stops when magic quotes or register globals are turned on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Autoloading is set. <code>Autoloader</code> is instantiated and <code>autoload.php</code> is loaded.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>DependencyInjectionContainer</code> (DIC) is instantiated and <code>providers.php</code> is loaded.</li>
    <li>
        Errors are turned into <code>ErrorException</code>s and exception handler is set.</li>
    <li>
        <code>FrontController</code> is instantiated using DIC. An implementation of <code>RouterInterface</code> is injected at instantiation.</li>
    <li>
        <code>FrontController::dispatch()</code> is called.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Routing the request</h2>
<p>Before the <code>FrontController</code> </p>


<p>At the end, <code>Carrot\Core\Interfaces\ResponseInterface::send()</code> is called, sending the response header and body to the client.</p>
