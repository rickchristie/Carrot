GENERAL
-------

TODO: Start making unit tests!


CORE FEATURES/CHANGES
---------------------

TODO: Finish the guide pages.

TODO: Fatal error handler in register_shutdown_function?

TODO: Fix the router class to be flexible, to accept quick regex
      or special syntax routes and also accept binding of route
      classes. Kind of like the DIC accepts quick bindings to
      eliminate the need to code simple factories but also provide
      the ability to use provider classes for complex instances.
      Figure out the syntax to be used in quick syntax and API
      for regex mode.

TODO: Write custom exception classes for core exceptions thrown,
      assign error code for them, and then in the exception
      handler, you can try to dynamically load pointers and hints
      of how the problem began and how to solve it.


NEW MODULES/CLASSES
-------------------
      
TODO: Carrot\Session package, get hints from Symfony, add flash
      variable, different storage mechanism support, consider
      SessionStorageInterface.

TODO: Carrot\Helper\Config, for immutable configuration files.

TODO: Carrot\Helper\URL, with autodetection for base URL and stuff.

TODO: Carrot\Validation package, make it easier to use! Use lambda
      function for on the spot validation function, or callbacks.
      Take hints from Zend_Validation.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

TODO: Fix comments on all classes, add @throws to denote exception
      thrown, and why it is thrown.

TODO: Fix comments on all classes, add @see to denote protected
      class caller.

TODO: Use the 'use' keyword for all classes, but only once.

TODO: Fix comments on Database library (you changed namespaces,
      wait for it to stabilize).


DONE
----

TODO: Create an core event manager to handle callbacks (see
      Symfony's event handler for inspiration). There would be
      events like 'Carrot\Core\System!Bootstrap',
      'Carrot\Core\System!ResponseReturned', or
      'Carrot\Core\System!RouteDiscovered'. Example use cases
      include redirecting links like '/blog/title' to
      '/blog/title/' for canonical version, filtering the final
      response body, request/response logging, for initializing
      PHP session and setting session save settings/handlers
      before the script is started, for privilege checking after
      routing is done, etc.


CANCELLED
---------

TODO: Inject the DIC and Autoloader to the exception handler for
      debugging purposes. Have the DIC log which instance names
      are instantiated (how many times) and providers used
      (if any). Have the Autoloader load which file is loaded and
      what class is expected on that file, the time of the load,
      which file gets loaded first, etc.

TODO: Also for debugging purposes, inject the Router to the
      ExceptionHandler so that it can read some information from
      it, like what is the active route ID and which callback was
      returned from the routing.
