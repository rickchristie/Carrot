GENERAL
-------

TODO: Start making unit tests!

CORE FEATURES/CHANGES
---------------------

TODO: Refactor index.php to use Bootstrap class using BootstrapInterface? Then you can inject ExceptionHandler to it? Or create an event system, see Symfony's event manager.
TODO: ExceptionHandler is still not flexible. Users cannot run custom callbacks or handle unhandled exception by themselves. Maybe use event manager?
TODO: Place the lifecycle type to the instance name, example: Carrot\Core\Router@Main:transient or Carrot\Core\Router@Main:singleton. This requires it to be explicitly set, which forces people to really think of each class's state and removes the need for ProviderInterface::isSingleton() method. It also makes it clearer, people don't have to look at the provider class to find out if the instance is shared or transient.
TODO: Bring back internal redirection? Will need major redesign in 'index.php' and FrontController, but may be worth it since you can implement HMVC with it.

NEW MODULES/CLASSES
-------------------

TODO: Carrot\Helper\Template, to be used by view classes. Make the dependency as loose as possible.
TODO: Carrot\Database\MySQLi, extend the original MySQLi class, add factory method to create the StatementWrapper.
TODO: Carrot\Session package, get hints from Symfony, add flash variable, different storage mechanism support, consider SessionStorageInterface.
TODO: Carrot\Helper\Config, for immutable configuration files.
TODO: Carrot\Helper\URL, with autodetection for base URL and stuff.
TODO: Carrot\Validation package, make it easier to use! Use lambda function for on the spot validation function, or callbacks. Take hints from Zend_Validation.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

TODO: Fix comments on all classes, add @throws to denote exception thrown, and why it is thrown.
TODO: Fix comments on all classes, add @see to denote protected class caller.
TODO: Use the 'use' keyword for all classes.
TODO: Fix comments on all classes to use full namespaces, for every @param and @return, use full namespace for object type, so @param \MySQLi_STMT $stmt comments.
TODO: Fix comments on Database library (you changed namespaces, wait for it to stabilize).
